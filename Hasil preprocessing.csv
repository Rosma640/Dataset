584,"I've been using Spotify for years and liked it a lot. But since I got a new phone with Android 14 it all went downhill - playback is going silent at random and not even skipping to next song. Also, connection in my car is also unstable, sometimes it plays, sometimes just silent and I need to reconnect. Seems like mix of OS version, BT (?) and Spotify problem. Which wasn't there on Android 12 with same app version.

630,Force stops all the time now. Spotify use to be able to run all day without force stopping. Now every 30 minutes-1hour it'll just stop for no reason. Getting sick of it. It's updated and I have Uninstalled and reinstalled already. It's just way past the time I go to another app bc putting lyrics behind a paywall? Not being able to look through an artists song and click on it like you use to be able to for free? Are you for real? Plus it's not like they pay artists what they deserve.

As soon as I turned on the radio with bluetooth, it would play the last thing I was listening to. Now it doesnt play anything and when I try to open the app, the app just shows a dark frozen screen until I turn off my radio, and restart the app. And today it doesnt want to play on my phone at all.

843,"I've loved this app for about a year (premium specifically). But recent updates have made the app almost annoying to use. For one, a feature that I adored has been removed. Is that being a pop-up if a song is already in your playlist and the ""skip songs already in playlist?"" option. That was probably my favorite thing about this streaming specifically. Making a playlist was fun and easy with that feature.

879,"I've been debating for a while whether to post a review. I used to love this app. Now I can't recommend it. Even with updates, the app works less and less well. Buttons now often work only after a slow reload. Features have been added that make it clunkier to use. I get recommendations that are not accurate to my tastes or genres. I get notifications that are about music, events, artists I'm not interested in. It's gone downhill since I wrote a glowing review in 2021. And it costs more!

948,"Overall very good app. I have very little experience with the free plan, as I use premium. I love the new AI DJ feature, and I would reccomend that in the future you should be able to tell it what you want to listen to, and it reccomend songs based on that, but it's very good. The only issue I have is that if a pause my music and don't return to it for a while, when I do come back to it, the current song that I was listening to doesn't play until I skip and then go back.
